 * The biome generator. External plugins are allowed to implement this class
 * on their own as long as it is registered using
 * {@link BiomeModeManager#register(String, Class)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A biome generator doesn't have to implement all methods in this class. If
 * it can't generate biomes at a lower precision, {@link
 * #getBiomesUnZoomed(int[], int, int, int, int, OutputType)} doesn't have to
 * be overridden. If it doesn't have its own cache, {@link #cleanupCache()}
 * and {@link #getBiome(int, int)} also don't have to be overridden.
 *
 * <p>
 * Two methods exist to detect whether the generator supports {@link
 * #canGenerateUnZoomed() unzoomed biomes} and {@link #isCached() cached
 * lookups}. By default, both methods return {@code false}. If the biome
 * generator does support those features the methods must be overridden.
